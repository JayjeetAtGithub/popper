_Popper_ is a convention for conducting scientific explorations and writing 
academic articles following a 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) approach. Popper allows 
researchers to automate the re-execution and validation of 
experimentation (computational and analysis) pipelines. To learn more 
about Popper you can:

  * Read the [overview][overview] or our [blog][blog].
  * Download our [publications][pubs].
  * Browse through a [list of repositories][popperized] that follow 
    the convention.
  * [Email us](mailto:ivo@cs.ucsc.edu), 
    [chat](https://gitter.im/systemslab/popper) or [open an 
    issue](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues/new).
  * Visit our [documentation][docs], where you can learn how to:
      * Use the [Popper-CLI][cli] to ["Popperize" experimentation 
        pipelines][quick-start].
      * Continuously validate the status of a pipeline by using 
        [continuous integration][ci].
      * Learn more about how Popper relates to [other existing 
        software](http://popper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/popper_vs_other_software.html).

We are currently working with researchers in many domains to extend 
the number of [popperized 
repositories](https://github.com/popperized). If you are interested in 
contributing but are not certain on how to start, please feel free to 
contact us.
